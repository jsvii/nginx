        "download_url": "https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/abs-guide.html.tar.gz",
        "desc": "This document is both a tutorial and a reference on shell scripting with Bash. It assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction . . . all the while sneaking in little nuggets of UNIXÂ® wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn scripting is to write scripts. \nThis book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to programming concepts."

Also Linux features, such as installation methods for laptops, notebooks and PDAs as well as configurations for different (network) environments are described.\nAlthough there are some caveats, Linux is a better choice for mobile computer devices than most other operating systems. Because it supports numerous installation methods, works in many heterogenoues environments and needs smaller resources."
